❄️ **Chilly and Frosty!** – _"What’s a snowman’s favorite snack? Ice Krispies!"_ 🥶

## 🛠️ The Journey

It was late at night, and the clock was ticking as the hackathon deadline loomed. ⏰ The APIs weren’t cooperating, and I was knee-deep in debugging, but I knew I had to make it work. Fueled by determination (and a lot of coffee ☕), I kept pushing through the setbacks. In the end, seeing MoodyWeather come to life made every challenge worth it – a reminder of why I love building things from scratch. 🚀
